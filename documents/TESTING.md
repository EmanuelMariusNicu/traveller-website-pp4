# Website Testing

## HTML and CSS Validation Testing

- All pages were passed through either the [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), [JSHint JavaScript Linter](https://jshint.com/)


###  W3C HTML Validator (Validate by URI)
- No errors, just few warnings.
###  W3C CSS Validator (Validate by direct input)
- Np errors
## Lighthouse
- All pages were ran through Lighthouse on Chrome Devtools for both desktop and mobile device display. Ran in incognito mode. Any issues were dealt with and all now have a high passing mark with any exceptions detailed in linked documents.
