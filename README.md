## Scope
### Research
- Before any planning, I conducted research into both social media and trip/blog websites and took note of the conventional layouts and formats as well as which features I thought enhanced the user's experience and would be good to include for my target audience(s).

### Future Features

#### Difficulty
- Either inputted by the poster at time of creation, the trip could be assigned a difficulty (beginner, intermediate or pro) so that user's can select based on their current abilities.

#### Time Requirements
- Similarly to difficulty, the time requirememnts could be added to the trip so that users can select based on their available time.
 

### Testing
- Throughout the project, I relied heavily on [Chrome Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to help me view this project on different screen sizes so that I could adjust elements, create media queries (by adding bootstrap classes) for responsive design.
- Code was also run through validators and automatic tests were run.

## Structure

### Wireframes

### Information architecture
- TravellerWorld is a blog-style site with multiple pages which relies on the MVC framework: Django to present information from a trip database and provide CRUD functionality.
- Trips are presented as cards whilst browsing and full page views when viewing.The cards link to the trip viewer.
- Trips can be browsed using words within the post or searching in the search bar in the top right of the navbar.
- The home page displays 2 rows with trip cards.
- All pages are responsive thanks to bootstrap classes.
- Browsing/search results pages present the related trips in a large flex container.

## Surface

### Design

#### Colour scheme

- The colour-scheme is vibrant but soft to provide a pleasing display and compliment any trips images displayed on the site. The tone of the colours were chosen to compliment the bootstrap *light* and *secondary* classes as ashown above.
- Bootstrap border and background colours were used on secondary features. Bootstrap button colours also used.

#### Imagery
- Images are uploaded by the users and stored in Cloudinary database.
- There are placeholder images for trips
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108750655/235296409-d2ff1665-a4a5-4dea-8030-28925c6dc9c0.png)



#### Typography
- All text is readable. It is a display 'Lucida sans serif' with rounded terminals. It is designed for display purposes but kept legible enough to use in small sizes as well. It pairs well with the softer colours and rounded corners of the design.
- Sans serif has been used as the fallback option since it is the closest web-safe font.

#### Icons
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used for navigation buttons.

### Deployment
- This site was developed using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), stored on [Github](https://github.com/) and deployed with [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

- Testing on Gitpod:
    1. In the terminal, type "python3 manage.py runserver" and press enter to begin the application
    2. Click "Open in Browser" on the pop-up
    3. Once finished, use Ctrl + C in the terminal to close the application

- Deploying on Heroku:
    1. From the homescreen, click "New" and select "Create new app"
    2. Choose app name, select region and click "Create"
    3. Go to "Settings" and add PORT : 8000 to the Config Vars (CLOUDINARY_URL : {cloudinary url}, DATABASE_URL: {postgres url}, SECRET_KEY: {django secure key} also added but excluded from Github for security reasons)
    4. Add heroku/python buildpack
    5. Go to "Deploy" and connect Github repository
    6. Select "Enable Automatic Deploys" and click "Deploy Branch"
