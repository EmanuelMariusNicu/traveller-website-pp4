## Code Validation

### HTML Validation
[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) is a service provided by the W3C that allows you to validate your HTML code against the official specifications. It checks for syntax errors, improper tag usage, and other issues that may affect the structure and semantics of your web pages. Validating your HTML code with W3C Markup Validation helps ensure that your pages are well-formed and adhere to web standards

All pages passed through the validation and the code was pasted in and I used a filter to remove issues related to the Django templating system. <details><summary>See filter</summary>![Result](/docs/validation/html/filter.png)</details>

### CSS Validation
[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your HTML and CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility.

### Python Validation 
[PEP 8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) is a style guide for writing Python code to ensure consistency and readability. It provides guidelines on how to format code, naming conventions for variables and functions, and other best practices. Following PEP 8 helps to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.

### Bugs
 - To be solved:
    - Cloudinary image size for all user post.
    - When trying the mobile responsiveness from F12 (developer tools), sometimes it doesn't work well the first time and needs a refresh or a click on the toggle device toolbar.
